#### PURPOSE 
To introduce participants to R Shiny user interfaces and demonstrate how they can be used to make health economic decision models more accessible to stakeholders.
 
#### DESCRIPTION
As health economic decision models become more computationally burdensome, the shortcomings of Microsoft Excel are becoming increasingly apparent. As a result, high level programming languages such as R are becoming more popular. The script-based nature of these languages may be perceived as lacking an accessible interface, limiting the extent to which stakeholders, who are not modellers, can engage with economic models. The R package ‘shiny’ provides an attractive solution: it allows the creation of easy-to-use web interfaces, which allow decision makers to directly interact with the decision model. Users can easily input their own assumptions and explore completely new scenarios in real-time. The underlying R code can be submitted alongside the interface to be reviewed and transparently debugged. In the future, R Shiny user interfaces could complement HTA submissions and improve health policy decision making.
 
#### AGENDA

- Interactive coding tutorial: building a simple Shiny app for a Markov model in R (Robert Smith)
- Tips for using R Shiny in practice for efficient scalability and multi-team projects (Rose Hart)
- Open questions and discussion
