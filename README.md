# R Shiny for HTA

Material for the ISPOR Workshop "R Shiny for HTA" - Dec 2021

Title: The Potential of R Shiny User Interfaces to Support Health Economic Decision Making

Discussion Leader: Paul Schneider (1,2)

Discussants: Gianluca Baio (4), Rose Hart (5), Robert Smith (1,2,3)

1) University of Sheffield; 2) Dark Peak Analytics, 3) UK Health Security Agency (DHSC); 4) UCL; 5) BresMed


PURPOSE: To introduce participants to R Shiny user interfaces and demonstrate how they can be used to make health economic decision models more accessible to stakeholders.
 
Sample demo: https://darkpeakanalytics.shinyapps.io/sadm-mk2/ 
 
DESCRIPTION: As health economic decision models become more computationally burdensome, the shortcomings of Microsoft Excel are becoming increasingly apparent. As a result, high level programming languages such as R are becoming more popular. The script-based nature of these languages may be perceived as lacking an accessible interface, limiting the extent to which stakeholders, who are not modellers, can engage with economic models. The R package ‘shiny’ provides an attractive solution: it allows the creation of easy-to-use web interfaces, which allow decision makers to directly interact with the decision model. Users can easily input their own assumptions and explore completely new scenarios in real-time. The underlying R code can be submitted alongside the interface to be reviewed and transparently debugged. In the future, R Shiny user interfaces could complement HTA submissions and improve health policy decision making.
 
The workshop will consist of 4 parts:
- Introduction to R and Shiny in HTA: current situation and future potential (Gianluca Baio) – 10 mins
- Interactive coding tutorial: building a simple Shiny app for a Markov model in R (Robert Smith) – 30 mins
- Tips for using R Shiny in practice for efficient scalability and multi-team projects (Rose Hart) – 10 mins
- Open questions and discussion – 10 mins

Audience interactive element:
- Interactive R Shiny coding tutorial
- Source code will be provided to all participants
- Audience practice use of pre-deployed apps, demonstrating their utility.
